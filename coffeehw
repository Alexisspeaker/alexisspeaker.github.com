Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by 
pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the tea
plant, Camellia sinensis. After water, tea is the most 
widely consumed beverage in the world. It has a cooling,
slightly bitter, astringent flavour that many people enjoy.
Tea has been promoted for having a variety of positive
health benefits, though generally these benefits have not
been adequately demonstrated in humans. The phrase 
"herbal tea" usually refers to infusions of fruit or herbs 
made without the tea plant, such as rosehip tea, 
chamomile tea or rooibos tea. Alternative phrases for this 
are tisane or herbal infusion, both bearing an implied
contrast with "tea" as it is construed here.

Coffee is a brewed beverage with a distinct aroma 
and flavor, prepared from the roasted seeds of the
Coffee plant. It is one of the most consumed
drinks in the world.Many studies have examined 
the health effects of coffee, and whether the overall
effects of coffee consumption are positive
or negative has been widely disputed. The method of 
brewing coffee has been found to be important in 
relation to its effects on health. For instance,
preparing coffee in a French press leaves more oils 
in the drink compared with coffee prepared with a 
paper coffee filter. This might raise the drinker's 
level of "bad cholesterol."
